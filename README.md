# Unhandled Database Query Error in Express.js Route Handler

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: missing error handling for database queries within route handlers.  Improper handling can lead to application crashes or unexpected behavior when a database query fails.

## Bug Description

The `bug.js` file contains an Express.js route handler that fetches user data from a database. If the query fails (e.g., user not found), the handler lacks proper error handling, potentially causing an unhandled exception or returning a cryptic response.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution that incorporates robust error handling.  It uses try-catch blocks to gracefully handle potential database query errors and returns appropriate HTTP error responses with informative messages.
